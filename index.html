      Emacs is a <strong>highly extensible text editor</strong>. It is
      built on a C core, and provides a fully
      featured <strong>Lisp</strong> environment
      (<a href="https://xkcd.com/224/">the language from which <em> the
          Gods wrought the universe</em></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a reason why Emacs was
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200910190321/http://www.jtnimoy.net/item.php?handle=14881671-tron-legacy" title="Emacs

    </p>
    <img src="img/emacs.png" alt="Emacs" class="mobile"/>
    <p>
      You can use Emacs for all of your text processing needs,
      internet and social network interactions, hacking, coding,
      managing to-do's and organizing your daily schedule, playing
      Tetris, and many other awesome things. It can even provide you
      with free psychotherapy and counseling using the built
      in <code>doctor</code>. A vibrant community of hackers is
      constantly writing new extensions, thanks to the power of the
      Emacs Lisp environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      GNU Emacs is <strong>Free Software</strong>, both free as in free
      beer and free as in free speech. The original Emacs was written
      by <em>St. iGNUcius himself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; <strong>Richard
      Stallman</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only does it give the user
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four
      essential freedoms</a>, its architecture is built in such a way
      that you have the power to mold it, change it and make it comply
      to your computering needs.

    <h2>Why use Emacs?</h2>  Emacs is a very powerful text processor,
    giving you the power to manipulate documents quickly and
    efficiently. You can easily move through and edit paragraphs,
    sentences, words, and logical blocks; blaze through text using
    powerful search tools; and easily edit thousands of lines at once
    using regular expressions, keyboard macros and more.
    <h3>Colorful text editor</h3>
    <p>
      Emacs can be customized in every conceivable way, including its
      looks.  You
      can <a href="http://bzg.fr/emacs-strip-tease.html">strip it
      down</a>, choose between dozens of easy to install themes
      with <code>M-x load-theme</code>, or even create your own and
      share it with your friends. Here are a couple of nice theme galleries:
      <a href="http://emacsthemes.com/" title="Emacs Themes">Emacs Themes</a>,
      <a href="https://pawelbx.github.io/emacs-theme-gallery/" title="Emacs Theme Gallery">Emacs Theme Gallery</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Et tu, Programmer?</h3>
    <p>
      There are tools for every programming language out there. Lisp,
      Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, Erlang, JavaScript, C, C++, Prolog,
      Tcl, AWK, PostScript, Clojure, Scala, Perl, Haskell, Elixir all
      of these languages and more are supported in Emacs. Because of
      the powerful Lisp core, Emacs is easy to extend to add support
      for new languages if the urge strikes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You get lots of features out of the box, including syntax
      highlighting, automatic indentation, REPL support, debugging,
      code browsing, version control integration and much more.
    </p>
    <h3>Vim user?</h3>
    <p>
      Let me tell you about <a href="http://spacemacs.org/" title="Spacemacs">
      Spacemacs</a>! Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution that
      brings together the world of Vim and Emacs into one text editor. It also
      features ergonomics and mnemonic key binding design, and also works great as a
      starter pack for newcomers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you just want to use Vim inside Emacs, you can check out
      <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">Evil Mode</a>, an extensible
      vi layer for Emacs that emulates the main features of Vim.
    </p>
    <h3>More!</h3>
    <p>
      <code><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a></code> helps
      you to keep notes, maintain TODO lists, plan projects and author
      documents. You can use your Org documents to create HTML
      websites like this one or export to LaTeX, Beamer, OpenDocuments
      and many other formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Tramp</code> allows you to edit remote files without
      leaving Emacs. You can seamlessly edit files on remote servers
      via SSH or FTP, edit local files with su/sudo, and much more.

      Use the built in IRC client <code>ERC</code> along
      with <code>BitlBee</code> to connect to your favorite chat
      services, or use the Jabber package to hop on any XMPP service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the box Emacs includes a mail client, web browser,
      calendar, and games; you can even edit video and images inside
      Emacs. There
      are <a href="http://tracker.endlessparentheses.com/"
            title="Emacs archive tracker">more than 3,000</a> packages for
      Emacs, and more are written all the time. You can easily extend
      your Emacs with new packages
      from <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/">GNU

      It's not called the <em> self-documenting real-time display
        editor</em> for nothing. Emacs includes a great tutorial to
      <strong>teach you how to use Emacs while you're using
        Emacs</strong>. Mind blown? This is just the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Emacs and started it up, you will be  greeted
      with a welcome screen. From here you can click on
      the <em>Emacs Tutorial</em> link with your mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Or if you're the keyboard type</strong>, you can
      press <code>Alt + X</code> on your keyboard, which will take you
      to the <em>command mode</em> in the lower screen of Emacs. Type in
      <code>help-with-tutorial</code> and press Enter. You just
      entered the first of many Emacs commands. You know the warm
      fuzzies you just got? Get used to it, because there's more where
      that came from.
